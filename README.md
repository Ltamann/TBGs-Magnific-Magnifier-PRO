# TBG Magnific Magnifier Node for ComfyUI

The **TBG Magnific Magnifier** node is an advanced yet simple-to-use enhancement tool designed for tiled image generation and refinement within ComfyUI. It uses cutting-edge neuro-generative tile fusion and multi-path processing pipelines tailored for extreme resolution workflows ‚Äî supporting images up to (but not limited to) 100 megapixels with high fidelity or high freedom.

The TBG Magnific Magnifier **enables multi-step automatic upscaling** with very simple, easy-to-use settings like **Creativity, Reassemblance, Fractality,** and **Inventivity**, giving users powerful control without complexity.

## Key Features

- **AI Image Enhancement**

## Parameter Overview
![TBG Magnific Magnifier Example](Node.png)  

### üîπ **Fractality**

> A tile size multiplier controlling detail randomness during upscaling.

- **Lower values**: introduce more randomness and abstract patterns.  
- **Higher values**: retain more of the original image‚Äôs structure.  

**Impact:**  
Fractality determines how much fractal-like detail is generated.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Higher values require exponentially more GPU memory!**

> My test settings require around **28GB VRAM** during the refinement pass.  
If you're not using an RTX 5090, consider lowering Fractality, turning off the refinement pass, or using GGUF/optimization techniques to reduce VRAM usage.

---

### üîπ **Creativity**

> Controls the balance between faithful detail preservation and creative freedom.

- **Lower values**: yield consistent, refined results that closely follow the input.  
- **Higher values**: allow for reinterpretation, abstract variations, and novel detail generation.

**Impact:**  
Affects how "safe" or "imaginative" the upscale becomes.  
Creativity is automatically **scaled down** during **multi-step upscaling** to maintain control.

---

### üîπ **Inventivity**

> Boosts micro-detail creation and enhances or invents textures.

- Adds realistic or artistic **small-scale details** that may not exist in the original.  
- Particularly useful in **low-resolution** areas or flat surfaces.

**Impact:**  
Inventivity enhances perceived richness in skin, fabric, nature, and more.  
üß† **Tip:** Prompt phrasing significantly affects Inventivity. In some cases, you may need to **lower flux guidance** to retain control.

---

### üîπ **Reassemblance (Anchor)**

> Connects structure consistency to **ControlNet**, **Redux**, and **IPAdapter** features.

- **High values**: strongly preserve original layout and mega-structures.  
- **Low values**: allow for more freedom and restructuring.

**Impact:**  
Guides structural consistency during multi-step upscaling.  
Reassemblance dynamically adapts to Redux/ControlNet inputs.

---

### üîπ **Refinement Pass**

> An optional final step that enhances fine details after the upscale.

- Produces **sharper, cleaner, more complete** results.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires significantly more GPU memory** than standard steps.

**Use with caution** if you're on limited VRAM. Consider disabling it or optimizing other parameters to save memory.

## New Fusion Techniques use from TBG Enhanced Tiled Upscaler and Refiner Pro
### PRO Neuro-Generative Tile Fusion (NGTF)  
An advanced generative system that ‚Äúremembers‚Äù newly generated surroundings and dynamically adapts subsequent sampling steps. This enables high-denoise tile refinement with:  
- Global consistency across the entire image  
- Sharp, coherent details  
- Preservation of contextual relationships between tiles

---

This combination of technologies empowers the TBG Magnific Magnifier node to deliver high-quality, large-scale image generation and refinement workflows that maintain both detail and cohesion at massive resolutions ‚Äî all while keeping the user experience smooth and accessible.

The TBG ETUR Magnific Magnifier requires a Pro, Premium, or Unlimited membership. However, you can achieve the same results using the TBG Enhanced Upscaler and Refiner PRO with manual settings and a Free membership.

**Note: This node is now merged with the [ComfyUI-TBG-ETUR Enhanced Tiled Upscaler & Refiner Pro](https://github.com/Ltamann/ComfyUI-TBG-ETUR) project.**
